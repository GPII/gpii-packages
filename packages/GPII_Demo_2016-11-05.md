## Usage

Unzip both packages and double click on the executables inside. For GPII Demo
this is `GPII_Demo.exe`.  The GPII Demo contains a right clickable menu on the
task tray to test various personas (this will be absent in stable builds).

Our existing stand-alone USB and external NFC user listeners should work with 
this the demo.

## Development Notes

This is the first step of retooling what had been demos for the LGS (Library 
GPII System) Project to generalized GPII Demos.

This is a demo package consisting of 2 executables, the local GPII framework
running on the Atom Electron framework, and a separate Windows Proximity Sensor
user listener.  The user listeners will eventually be part of the local GPII
executable, but some work on the integration needs to be performed first.

This GPII Demo includes work from the following branches and pull requests, 
which at the time of writing are currently undergoing the core review process.

- [GPII-1596 Initial GPII Electron wrapper](https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1596)
- [GPII-2073 Persona Settings return on windows lock screen](https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2073)
- [GPII-1000 Support changing screen resolution in windows](https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1000)

Furthermore, this code contains the following work arounds:

- Swapping in device reporter code.  Still under investigation is a way to set
  the config, without the use of environment variables or command line arguments
  for embedding the GPII in Electron type frameworks.
  https://github.com/sgithens/universal/commit/1cf698871f7c8f999b2255b3f991bb780f142c27
- Changing localhost to 127.0.0.1.  Node.js has issues making localhost resolution
  on windows when there is no network connection.
  https://github.com/sgithens/universal/commit/76fcc948771e6ad695a8c77ad6489ce90504dea1
  https://github.com/sgithens/gpii-app/commit/99d01c86ec4bbc88a62097c92e2bb9681703b0cd
- Removing argv testing sections.  These were present in the windows code and broke
  since the GPII wasn't being run from the command line.
  https://github.com/sgithens/windows/commit/ad7f0a1cd44379b2743be3d8ace4920a3c156e57
- Manually deleting universal in gpii-windows.  I've had some problem with the 
  github repo's getting pulled correctly from package.json, and for this zip 
  have:
    1. Manually removed a duplicate universal in `node_modules/gpii-windows/node_modules`
    2. Removed the node_modules/universal and `git clone`d it and checked out the 
       branch manually.

Lastly, this work as been packaged in a pre-built Atom Electron release to 
make it possible to deliver it as a double-clickable executable on Windows.

This was achieved with the following pseudo shell operations:

- Download Electron pre-built
  https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.4.1
  https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/v1.4.1/electron-v1.4.1-win32-x64.zip
- Vagrant Up with my gpii-app, windows, and universal merged branches.
- Remove and replace the universal repo as detailed above.
- Rename electron-v1.4.1-win32-x64 to GPII_Demo
- mkdir GPII_Demo/resources/app
- cp gpii-app/* GPII_Demo/resources/app/
- Rename GPII_Demo/electron.exe to GPII_Demo/GPII_Demo.exe

### Windows Proximity listener

Additionally, the second bundle includes a small user listener written in C# that
works against NFC readers built in to our Sony Viao machines and many Windows 10
tablets.  Ideally this will eventually be moved over to Edge.js and run directly
in the local GPII instance.
