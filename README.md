# Packaged Demos and Releases for the GPII

This repository, along with it's releases area, contains integrated packages
for GPII Demos and Releases.  This packages are often the result of combining
code from many different GPII repositories, and performing extra build and
packaging steps at the end.

Each binary release will be categorized as `alpha`, `beta`, or `stable`.
`alpha` releases may or may not contain code from individual feature branches,
and often are hand assembled packages for demonstration purposes.

`beta` releases should tend to be primary made of code that has gone through a
master branch review process, and is nearly in the master branch. They should
also have some level of community involvement and testing.

`stable` packages will contain CI exercised code from our repositories, have a
solid level of community involvement QA, and sign off from set of official
team leads and release manager, depending on the package.

These are a generalized, evolving set of characteristics, but each package
releases should also contain documentation specifying the status and quality of
the package.
